* "illuminated macros"

** Macro = compiler hook

Hook into compiler to do arbitrary code. Whatever that is, it returns
more code. Macro arbitraty compiler.

We say they output clojure but not really the same. Input is macro
that undestarnds macro foo, and outputs code that doesnt understand
macro foo cos expanded

macro = function

work better when they are pure functions

Functions do three things : collect input, compute and emit

** illuminated macros

syntax documentation  - look at macro and be able to know how to use
it. Railroad diags? erorrs messages

visualisation of parsing - which bit of my result came from input

** defn macro

If a dsl doesnt have an escape... mayby you are triapped.


* Clojure - syntax errors

Erors: tells you what hwhen wrong with macros, but confusiong stack trce
